# Python
My Python Programmes - 
This is just a small fun compilation of basics of python logic and codes and some handouts that seemed useful to me from basic syntax, data structures, algorithmic 
problem's solutions to web scraping, database management, data visualization. I'll keep on adding my pactice algorithmic fun exercises. I made this project just for
my personal use, comments are just so that i'm able to understand them and i haven't added the questions too. Maybe in future, i'll make this more presentable and 
organise it so that it makes any sense, most probably, i'll not :p but if someone stumbles upon this among gargantuan other projects, go through them, if you find it
awfully messed up, please pardon and if you find it useful, you're a hero. XD Jokes aside, if you want some explanantion for these codes, just comment on them, I'll
be more than happy to explain them out and this is completely open to changes. Feel free to point out problems lingering in them.
